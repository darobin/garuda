    <section id="abstract">
      <p>
        Multiple proposals exist to reform programmatic advertising on the Web. Some, most
        notably <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/privacy-preserving-ads/blob/main/Parakeet.md">PARAKEET</a>,
        the <a href="https://github.com/WICG/turtledove/blob/master/FLEDGE.md">FLEDGE</a> bid server,
        and ongoing work by <a href="https://prebid.org/">Prebid</a>, rely on the existence of a
        <em>trustworthy</em> server that can perform tasks such as anonymising ad requests. This type
        of model has interesting properties, notably they are easier to audit and do not require
        moving significant chunks of logic into the browser, but they also suffer from the problem
        that the server itself must be trusted, even while sitting outside the realm of the user's
        control.
      </p>
      <p>
        This document drafts an overall vision and governance model able to support such
        trustworthy utility servers by having them owned and operated by an entity governed in
        common by different constituencies. The name comes from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garuda">Garuda</a>,
        which Wikipedia describes as "<em>the king of birds</em>" and "<em>a protector with the power
        to swiftly go anywhere, ever watchful</em>."

    <section>
      <h2>The Goal of Garuda</h2>
      <p>
        The objective of this proposal is to <em>make a trustworthy advertising server
        possible.</em> The notion of a trustworthy advertising server is a potentially very
        powerful one in that it can enable a number of highly-desirable use cases in advertising
        technology, notably that of anonymising requests. However, trust does not appear as if by
        magic and it needs to be designed for.
      </p>
      <p>
        Several suggestions have been made in order to make this trust possible, but none of them
        works just yet:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Just trust the publisher/intermediary/tech company</strong>. This is not a
          realistic option, certainly not for a system meant to operate in the wild and at this
          scale. The web is trustworthy <em>because</em> there is no need to trust a website. This
          property needs to be imported here.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Use some form of secure multiparty computation magic</strong>. Purely
          mathematical solutions are great in that they are highly enforceable; however it is not
          clear that this problem can be solved in full that way, straight from the browser.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>It's open source!</strong> That is great, and whatever Garuda produces will be
          open source, but just because something is open source doesn't prove that the system
          running it is actually running that open source implementation as is â€” it's pretty easy to
          cheat.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Rely on regulation or contracts</strong>. Our jobs as technologists would be a
          lot simpler if we could treat technology as neutral and offload figuring out the hard
          human parts to legislators. Unfortunately, that approach is not just not simple but
          simplistic. It does not account for the cost of contractual enforcement (who finances the
          audits, for instance) nor does it account for regulatory capture (which runs rampant in
          privacy).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Move everything into the browser</strong>. The browser is intended as a point of
          maximal trust for users, and to a large degree this trust is inescapable. Unfortunately,
          there is no longer consensus in the Web community that all major browsers are acting as
          trustworthy agents for the users and there is suspicion of self-dealing from some vendors,
          particularly relating to advertising. While I wish nothing more than to see trust in
          browsers rebuilt, this proposal endeavours to deal with the cards as have been given and
          not those I might wish we had had instead.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Garuda's core tenet is that we can solve problems of trust with human arrangements. On the
        downside, these are necessarily imperfect and they incur some overhead. On the upside, a
        group of people with effective checks and balances can handle complex and evolving
        situations better than anything else â€” and provide a strong foundation atop which to build
        trust between parties that, historically and structurally, have not trusted one another
        much.
      </p>
      <p>
        The responsibilities of the Garuda group include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Shepherding the technical standards that define the Garuda trustworthy server.</li>
        <li>Managing the open source implementation and maintenance of the trustworthy server.</li>
        <li>Operating the worldwide network of trustworthy servers and supporting their being
          audited.</li>
        <li>Ensuring the general health of the advertising ecosystem by providing a common space
          where stakeholders must reach some form of consensus in order for the system to operate.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Impossible, Inescapable Reform of Advertising</h2>
      <p>
        Digital advertising is an essential utility. It has rightly become hated through decades of
        mismanagement, but while other business models do exist and should prosper, they are simply
        insufficient to make up for the loss that eradicating advertising would cause. Our only
        option, then, is to fix it.
      </p>
      <p>
        While most parties support reform, it is proving politically difficult to achieve.
        Advertising is a complex environment involving multiple stakeholders that run completely
        different organisations and the pieces they provide must all more or less fit together for
        the system to function. The current system operates poorly â€” in some parts staggeringly so â€”
        but it does operate. Changing the way in which some parts fit together requires different
        stakeholders to agree to change in matching ways, and therein lies the rub.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is difficult to coordinate such a change because, for historical reason that we need not
        discuss here, most of the parties actively distrust one another.
      </p>
      <p>
        We therefore find ourselves presented with a choice: reform can either happen through
        vertical integration which will favour the most intergrated, or it can happen through
        multistakeholder standards. The latter is preferable since it is pro-competitive and can
        bring forward a healthier ecosystem in which more voices are represented, but it can only
        exist if we can develop a governance structure that will foster trust between stakeholders
        by empowering their participation and granting them auditing rights and principles to serve
        as checks and balances for the system.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is where a trustworthy server becomes a particularly useful construct. Since it
        <em>has</em> to be trusted by all stakeholders (no one would trust such a server operated by
        just one type of party), it provides a common space for browsers (representing users),
        publishers, and adtech intermediaries to meet, and where they can be put in a position of
        <em>needing</em> to achieve consensus for the system to operate.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Governance for Advertising</h2>
      <p>
        The past two decades in digital advertising have largely been defined by the avoidance of
        governance, and I believe that we have reached a stage at which most actors would agree it
        is time for a change. What would that look like?
      </p>
      <p>
        The proposed trustworthy servers look likely to all be open source. That is an important
        first step but is not sufficient. Just because a solution is open source does not prove that
        the code which one can inspect is what is running on a given server. Stronger guarantees of
        auditing and verification are required for this system to prove itself as trustworthy to all
        parties.
      </p>
      <p>
        Significant parts of the Internet's infrastructure operate under more or less formal
        governance arrangements. Standards, of course (W3C, IETF, WHATWG, TC-39), but also top-level
        domain names, internet peering, or the ISRG and Let's Encrypt. We can make this work for
        advertising too.
      </p>
      <p>
        Detailing a full governance model would be a longer undertaking that would require input
        from a variety of partners. I'm simply including a quick outline to show feasibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        The governance model can be summarised as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          There are three primary constituencies: browser vendors (vendors, not engines, and
          expected to proxy for users), publishers, and adtech intermediaries. For each of them,
          there are inclusion criteria that are based on volume of the traffic they see through the
          trustworthy server.
        </li>
        <li>
          Any entity eligible to be part of a constituency has some voting rights. These voting
          rights allow them to elect their representatives to the Governance Board for that
          constituency. Candidates can be nominated by any party with voting rights. Governance
          Board seats are open for three years with a third being renewed every year.
        </li>
        <li>
          Oversight over Garuda is managed by the Governance Board. Each constituency has three
          representatives on that board. No company can have more than one representative, even in
          different constituencies. If one constituency has fewer than two candidates in a given
          election, then it gains zero representation. (If interest from that group is too low, it
          shouldn't be taken over by a single party.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Supermajority rule: some changes require a supermajority of the Board. Supermajority is
          defined as:
          <ul>
            <li>
              â…”rd of the members of the Board vote in support; and
            </li>
            <li>
              at least one Board member from each constituency must vote in support (so if the
              three members from one constituency are agreed against, they effectively have veto
              power).
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Garuda operates according to fundamental ethical principles (which need to be written
          before it kicks off). These principles can be changed with supermajority. The purpose of
          these principles is to guide the Board's discussions and inform its decisions. All Board
          deliberations are public (with perhaps a few exceptions for personnel matters).
        </li>
        <li>
          The Governance Board selects (by consensus) an Executive Director every three years.
          There is a strong assumption that the Executive Director will not necessarily be renewed:
          every time a new ED must be selected, the Board is expected to review multiple candidates.
          The Board can revoke the ED with supermajority.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Executive Director leads the Garuda Legal Entity, under the control of the Board.
          The Legal Entity is tasked with day to day operations, including of the servers, with
          research into future technology that Garuda could use, with organising the various working
          groups that will bring stakeholders together to help evolve Garuda over time, and with the
          elaboration of policy positions which Garuda will cooperate with regulators on.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Legal Entity is financed through a very small tax on advertising. Two models are
          possible: one is a flat fee per request, another is a percentage of effective CPM. The
          latter is preferred in that it will incentivise Garuda to increase effectiveness of
          advertising (whereas the former incentivises volume) but may prove more complicated to
          build, especially in terms of how to avoid lying about it (so long as it's above the
          provided bid floor). The amount and type of the tax is determined by the Board. The
          overall taxation structure might further depend on the type of operation requested, since
          not all are equally computationally expensive, and making sure that we properly cost in
          computational cost is important from an ecological point of view.
        </li>
        <li>
          Part of the tax should further be set aside to provide financial support to stakeholders
          who cannot afford to pay someone to spend time in Board discussions, so as to ensure that
          participants from companies of all sizes, and from all backgrounds the world around can
          participate with equity.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Use Cases This Opens Up</h2>
      <p>
        The immediate focus is on getting enough of a PARAKEET-like structure off the ground, so
        that we can have an open source system and the server infrastructure to operate it in a
        trustworthy fashion up and running. But longer-term, more can be done from this position
        because the PARAKEET server creates a "place" of sort which can implement multiple adtech
        functions in such a way that multiple stakeholders have to reach consensus as to how it
        works. This can progressively build a way out of the current unilateral, conflict-driven
        model that is causing so much strife across the ecosystem.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some problems that this could help address are listed below. Note that I am deliberately
        staying at a very high level for the time being as I do not believe that any of these should
        be the first area of focus.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Fraud</strong>: putting control over fraud prevention not just with
          intermediaries would incentivise making it more effective. The trustworthy server has
          access to detailed user information that can support fraud detection. How this would
          integrated safely with fraud detection vendors is an open question.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Malvertising</strong>: users and publishers have strong incentives to prevent
          malvertising, but are not usually in a position to do much about it. This would also help
          provide the line of defence that they expect. Detecting malvertising at the trustworthy
          level will cause less revenue loss than when it happens on the publisher side. This should
          also make it easier to collaborate across servers to weed out dangerous creatives.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Privacy</strong>: the system is designed for that, but it could be extended to
          protect user privacy in further contexts.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Accountability</strong>: the current system is opaque and operates with no audit
          or control, and not visibility from most actors including publishers and users. Garuda
          could help bring about a position of farm-to-table accountability and traceability for
          creatives, of revenue transparency, and could help comply with coming regulations such as
          the DSA â€” though that would also require changes to upstream intermediaries as well.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Brand Safety</strong>: this is a topic that needs to be managed with publisher
          input, instead of the system we have now that doesn't work for anyone. Attesting agents on
          the Garuda server could analyse the content of the page using a methodology of their own,
          and pass an attestation in the bid that the page is brand safe. The methodology in
          question would only be allowed to run on Garuda after consensus is found that it is not
          unilaterally detrimental to publishers.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Creative Quality</strong>: ad creatives are produced with low quality
          engineering and are often highly wasteful of resources, with the cost of poor experience
          being borne by the publisher and user. This is a point of intervention for the server.
          Managing creative quality is similar to malvertising at a technical level, but the
          governance is different: we need the stakeholders to agree on what quality can get
          blocked, and the buy side needs to be informed that their ads are being dropped.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Known Issues</h2>
      <p>
        These issues need to be addressed before this can move forward.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>The buy side is not represented</h3>
        <p>
          The buy side is where the money comes from and is the set of sources who have the strongest
          incentives to keep everyone honest in terms of fraud, effectiveness, and brand safety.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are several problems to solve here, though.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first is <u>how to pick who is legitimately in that constituency</u>? For the other
          three constituencies, we can gate on volume thresholds as measured by the Garuda system
          itself. This makes for a reasonably easy system to select who is in the polity and has the
          right to vote. For the buy side, one step removed, this is more complex. We probably cannot
          scale this to every store that bought $300's worth of ads in the local paper (though, if
          that were possible, it might be interesting). This would make it too easy and too cheap to
          buy votes, too.
        </p>
        <p>
          One potential solution is to make it so that the Garuda system knows who is paying for
          every creative that it eventually serves. If the system supports farm-to-table traceability
          and revenue transparency, this is a requirement anyway as the creative will need to contain
          verifiable information about who paid for it and how much. Extracting this payment
          information would make it possible to establish a volume threshold (in spend) for the
          buy-side to be represented.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second issue is <u>how to ensure that the constituencies are balanced</u>?
          Historically, the interests of the buy-side and of the intermediaries have often aligned
          against users, with publishers splitting between the two. This would almost guarantee
          user-hostile outcomes such as a return to transparency &amp; control regimes or the
          rejection of user agents as the user's fiduciary.
        </p>
        <p>
          This could perhaps be addressed with principles (which we need anyway, and that would
          prevent approaching users from an adversarial angle), which can't be changed without support
          from at least one entity in each constituency, and also from the fact that if such
          user-hostile tactics were to become supported in Garuda then the browsers would just walk,
          returning the world to ad blocking and the such. But that feels like a relatively weak
          protection.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another way to address would be to add a fifth constituency being consumer organisations
          (and having the browsers represent themselves only). But I have no idea how to select that
          polity.
