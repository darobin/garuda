      <p>
        Multiple proposals exist to reform programmatic advertising on the Web. Some, most
        notably <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/privacy-preserving-ads/blob/main/Parakeet.md">PARAKEET</a>,
        the <a href="https://github.com/WICG/turtledove/blob/master/FLEDGE.md">FLEDGE</a> bid server,
        and ongoing work by <a href="https://prebid.org/">Prebid</a>, rely on the existence of a
        <em>trustworthy</em> server that can perform tasks such as anonymising ad requests. This type
        of model has interesting properties, notably they are easier to audit and do not require
        moving significant chunks of logic into the browser, but they also suffer from the problem
        that the server itself must be trusted, even while sitting outside the realm of the user's
        control.
      </p>
      <p>
        This document drafts an overall vision and governance model able to support such
        trustworthy utility servers by having them owned and operated by an entity governed in
        common by different constituencies. The name comes from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garuda">Garuda</a>,
        which Wikipedia describes as "<em>the king of birds</em>" and "<em>a protector with the power
        to swiftly go anywhere, ever watchful</em>."

      <h2>The Impossible, Inescapable Reform of Advertising</h2>
      <p>
        Digital advertising has rightly become despised through decades of mismanagement, but it
        nevertheless is an essential utility. While other business models do exist and should
        prosper, they are simply insufficient to make up for the loss that eradicating advertising
        would cause. Our only option, then, is to fix it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most parties support reform, but it is proving politically difficult to achieve.
        Advertising is a complex environment involving multiple stakeholders that run completely
        different organisations yet the pieces they provide must all more or less fit together for
        the system to function. The current system operates poorly â€” in some parts staggeringly so â€”
        but it does operate. Changing the way in which some parts fit together requires different
        stakeholders to agree to change in matching ways, and therein lies the rub.
      </p>
      <p>
        Coordinate change is difficult at all times, but in digital advertising it is particularly
        challenging because most of the parties actively distrust one another.
      </p>
      <p>
        We therefore find ourselves presented with a choice: reform can either happen through
        vertical integration which will favour the most integrated, or it can happen through
        multistakeholder standards. The latter is preferable as it can bring forward a healthier
        ecosystem in which more voices are represented, but it can only exist if we develop a
        principled governance structure to foster trust between stakeholders.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is where a trustworthy server becomes a particularly useful construct. Since it
        <em>has</em> to be trusted by all stakeholders (no one would trust such a server operated by
        just one type of party), it provides a common space for browsers (representing users),
        publishers, and adtech intermediaries to meet, and where they can be put in a position of
        <em>needing</em> to achieve consensus for the system to operate.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Objective</h2>
      <p>
        The goal of Garuda is to <em>make a trustworthy advertising server
        possible.</em> The notion of a trustworthy advertising server is a potentially very
        powerful one in that it can enable a number of highly-desirable use cases in advertising
        technology, notably that of anonymising requests. However, trust does not appear as if by
        magic and it needs to be designed for.
      </p>
      <p>
        Several suggestions have been made in order to make this trust possible, but none of them
        works today:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Just trust the publisher/intermediary/tech company</strong>. This is not a
          realistic option, certainly not for a system meant to operate in the wild and at this
          scale. The web is trustworthy <em>because</em> there is no need to trust a website. This
          property needs to be imported here.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Use some form of secure multiparty computation magic</strong>. Purely
          mathematical solutions are great in that they are highly enforceable; however it is not yet
          clear that this problem can be solved in full that way, straight from the browser.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>It's open source!</strong> That is great, and whatever Garuda produces will be
          open source, but just because something is open source doesn't prove that the system
          running it is actually running that open source implementation as is â€” it's pretty easy to
          cheat.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Rely on regulation or contracts</strong>. Our jobs as technologists would be a
          lot simpler if we could treat technology as neutral and offload figuring out the hard
          human parts to legislators. Unfortunately, that approach is not just not simple but
          simplistic. The past two decades of digital advertising regulation have relied on
          contractual obligations and user-hostile choice architectures, with effectively nothing to
          show for it.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Move everything into the browser</strong>. The browser is intended as a point of
          maximal trust for users, and to a large degree this trust is inescapable. Unfortunately,
          there is no longer consensus in the Web community that all major browsers are acting as
          trustworthy agents for the users and there is suspicion of self-dealing from some vendors,
          particularly relating to advertising. Rebuilding trust in browsers is a highly desirable
          outcome, but sits outside the scope that we tackle here. This proposal endeavours to deal
          with the cards we have been given and not those I might wish we had had instead.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Garuda's core tenet is that we can solve problems of trust with human arrangements. On the
        downside, these are necessarily imperfect and they incur some overhead. On the upside, a
        group of people with effective checks and balances can handle complex and evolving
        situations better than anything else â€” and provide a strong foundation atop which to build
        trust between parties that, historically and structurally, do not trust one another much.
      </p>

      <h2>Responsibilities</h2>
      <p>
        Garuda is an institutional arrangement composed of several constituencies and groups that
        together form the <dfn data-lt="institution">Garuda institution</dfn>. The
        [=Garuda institution=] has several responsibilities:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Shepherding the technical standards that define the Garuda trustworthy server</dt>
        <dd>
          Garuda will need to cooperate with the <a href="https://w3.org/">W3C</a> and with
          <a href="https://web-platform-tests.org/">WPT</a> in order to guarantee that the technical
          standards that define how all parties integrate and interact with the trusted server are
          interoperable, royalty-free, and in line with the ethical principles of the Web and the
          Internet ([[?ETHICAL-WEB]], [[?RFC8890]]).
        </dd>
        <dt>Managing the open source implementation and maintenance of the trusted server</dt>
        <dd>
          The trusted server will be developed in an open source manner, but changes made to the code
          will need to be aligned with the objectives of the [=institution=], which will need to be
          reflected in the change review process. Further, there is no expectation that software
          development will be entirely carried out by the community; rather the [=institution=]
          should provision sufficient resources to underwrite the entirety of the server's
          development.
        </dd>
        <dt>Operating the worldwide network of trustworthy servers</dt>
        <dd>
          The [=institution=] will operate a network of trustworthy servers with high-performance
          SLAs and an arrangement that enables easy auditing. This is intended to be core
          infrastructure for the entire Web, and requires a level of quality and scale to match.
        </dd>
        <dt>Ensuring the general health of the advertising ecosystem</dt>
        <dd>
          By providing a common space where stakeholders must reach some form of consensus in order
          for the system to operate, the [=institution=] is taking on some responsibility for the
          health of the broader digital advertising ecosystem.
        </dd>
      </dl>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Governance Model</h2>
      <p>
        This section provides only an outline of the governance model for the [=Garuda institution=].
        At this stage, my purpose is solely to describe the approach and sketch out enough of its
        mechanics to establish feasibility. Development of the full principles and bylaws will, by
        nature, have to be an open and multistakeholder exercise.
      </p>
      <p>
        Significant parts of the Internet's infrastructure operate under more or less formal
        governance arrangements. Standards, of course (W3C, IETF, WHATWG, TC-39), but also top-level
        domain names, internet peering, or the ISRG and Let's Encrypt. We can make this work for
        advertising too.
      </p>
      <p>
        The [=Garuda institution=] is comprised of two primary bodies: the [=Governance Board=] and
        the [=Legal Entity=].
      </p>
      <p>
        The <dfn data-lt="Board">Governance Board</dfn> is tasked with the oversight of the
        [=institution=]. It concerns itself primarily with the [=principles=], which it will control
        for in the behaviour of the [=Legal Entity=] as well as the technical standards and open
        source implementation of the trusted server. It also names the [=Executive Director=].
        All [=Board=] deliberations are public (with perhaps a few exceptions for personnel matters).
      </p>
      <p>
        The <dfn data-lt="LE">Legal Entity</dfn> takes care of day-to-day operations. It is
        responsible for maintaining, deploying, and operating the trusted server at requisite SLAs
        and at reasonable cost, as well as of research into future technology that Garuda could use,
        with organising the various working groups that will bring stakeholders together to help
        evolve Garuda over time, and with the elaboration of policy positions which Garuda will
        cooperate with regulators on. It is run by the [=Executive Director=].
      </p>
      <p>
        The [=Board=] selects (by consensus) an <dfn data-lt="ED">Executive Director</dfn> every three years or
        whenever the post becomes vacant. There is a strong assumption that the [=Executive Director=]
        will not necessarily be renewed: every time a new [=ED=] must be selected, the [=Board=] is
        expected to review multiple candidates. The [=Board=] can revoke the [=ED=] with a
        [=supermajority=]. The [=ED=] leads the [=Legal Entity=].
      </p>
      <p>
        Garuda operates according to fundamental <dfn data-lt="principles">ethical principles</dfn>
        (which need to be written before it kicks off, [[?ETHICAL-WEB]], [[?RFC8890]], or [[?PUP]]
        are good starting points). These [=principles=] can be changed with [=supermajority=]. The
        purpose of these [=principles=] is to guide the [=Board=]'s discussions and inform its decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are three primary <dfn>constituencies</dfn>: browser vendors (vendors, not engines, and
        expected to proxy for users), publishers, and adtech intermediaries. For each of them,
        there are inclusion criteria that are based on volume of the traffic they see through the
        trusted server. The volume threshold can differ per [=constituency=], it is designed to
        prevent gaming the system by spawning multiple entities. Entities with sufficient volume
        have voting rights on a one-entity/one-vote basis, there is no volume proration.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any entity eligible to be part of a [=constituency=] has some voting rights. These voting
        rights allow them to elect their representatives to the [=Governance Board=] for that
        [=constituency=]. Candidates can be nominated by any entity with voting rights.
        [=Board=] seats are open for three years with a third being renewed every year.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each [=constituency=] has three representatives on the [=Board=]. No company can have more
        than one representative, even if it participates in different [=constituencies=]. If one
        [=constituency=] has fewer than two candidates in a given election, then it gains zero
        representation. (If interest from that group is too low, it shouldn't be taken over by a
        single party.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <dfn>Supermajority</dfn>: some changes require a [=supermajority=] of the [=Board=].
        [=Supermajority=] is defined as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          â…”rd of the members of the [=Board=] vote in support; and
        </li>
        <li>
          at least one [=Board=] member from each [=constituency=] must vote in support (so if the
          three members from one [=constituency=] are agreed against, they effectively have veto
          power).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The [=Legal Entity=] is financed through a very small tax on advertising. Two models are
        possible: one is a flat fee per request, another is a percentage of effective CPM. The
        latter is preferred in that it will incentivise Garuda to increase effectiveness of
        advertising (whereas the former incentivises volume) but may prove more complicated to
        build, especially in terms of how to avoid lying about it (so long as it's above the
        provided bid floor). The amount and type of the tax is determined by the [=Board=]. The
        overall taxation structure might further depend on the type of operation requested, since
        not all are equally computationally expensive, and making sure that we properly cost in
        computational cost is important from an ecological point of view.
      </p>
      <p>
        Part of the tax should further be set aside to provide financial support to stakeholders
        who cannot afford to pay someone to spend time in [=Board=] discussions, so as to ensure that
        participants from companies of all sizes, and from all backgrounds the world around can
        participate with equity.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Use Cases</h2>
      <p>
        The immediate focus is on getting enough of a PARAKEET-like structure off the ground, so
        that we can have an open source system and the server infrastructure to operate it in a
        trustworthy fashion up and running. This should enable sufficient anonymisation in the ad
        environment to make it safe for users, and enable novel publisher techniques. But longer-term,
        more can be done from this position because the PARAKEET server creates a "place" of sort
        which can broker multiple adtech functions in such a way that multiple stakeholders have to
        reach consensus as to how it works. This can progressively build a way out of the current
        unilateral, conflict-driven model that is causing so much strife across the ecosystem.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some problems that this could help address are listed below. Note that I am deliberately
        staying at a very high level for the time being as I do not believe that any of these should
        be the first area of focus.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Fraud</strong>: putting control over fraud prevention not just with
          intermediaries would incentivise making it more effective. The trusted server has
          access to detailed user information that can support fraud detection. How this would
          integrated safely with fraud detection vendors is an open question.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Malvertising</strong>: users and publishers have strong incentives to prevent
          malvertising, but are not usually in a position to do much about it. This would also help
          provide the line of defence that they expect. Detecting malvertising at the trusted server
          level will cause less revenue loss than when it happens on the publisher side. This should
          also make it easier to collaborate across servers to weed out dangerous creatives.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Privacy</strong>: the system is designed for that, but it could be extended to
          protect user privacy in further contexts.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Accountability</strong>: the current system is opaque and operates with no audit
          or control, and not visibility from most actors including publishers and users. Garuda
          could help bring about a position of farm-to-table accountability and traceability for
          creatives, of revenue transparency, and could help comply with coming regulations such as
          the DSA â€” though that would also require changes to upstream intermediaries as well.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Brand Safety</strong>: this is a topic that needs to be managed with publisher
          input, instead of the system we have now that doesn't work for anyone. Attesting agents on
          the Garuda server could analyse the content of the page using a methodology of their own,
          and pass an attestation in the bid that the page is brand safe. The methodology in
          question would only be allowed to run on Garuda after consensus is found that it is not
          unilaterally detrimental to publishers.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Creative Quality</strong>: ad creatives are produced with low quality
          engineering and are often highly wasteful of resources, with the cost of poor experience
          being borne by the publisher and user. This is a point of intervention for the server.
          Managing creative quality is similar to malvertising at a technical level, but the
          governance is different: we need the stakeholders to agree on what quality can get
          blocked, and the buy side needs to be informed that their ads are being dropped.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Known Issues</h2>
      <p>
        These issues need to be addressed before this can move forward.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>Users are not represented</h3>
        <!-- XXX: the user issue is bigger -->
        <p>
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>The buy side is not represented</h3>
        <p>
          The buy side is where the money comes from and is the set of sources who have the strongest
          incentives to keep everyone honest in terms of fraud, effectiveness, and brand safety.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are several problems to solve here, though.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first is <u>how to pick who is legitimately in that constituency</u>? For the other
          three constituencies, we can gate on volume thresholds as measured by the Garuda system
          itself. This makes for a reasonably easy system to select who is in the polity and has the
          right to vote. For the buy side, one step removed, this is more complex. We probably cannot
          scale this to every store that bought $300's worth of ads in the local paper (though, if
          that were possible, it might be interesting). This would make it too easy and too cheap to
          buy votes, too.
        </p>
        <p>
          One potential solution is to make it so that the Garuda system knows who is paying for
          every creative that it eventually serves. If the system supports farm-to-table traceability
          and revenue transparency, this is a requirement anyway as the creative will need to contain
          verifiable information about who paid for it and how much. Extracting this payment
          information would make it possible to establish a volume threshold (in spend) for the
          buy-side to be represented.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second issue is <u>how to ensure that the constituencies are balanced</u>?
          Historically, the interests of the buy-side and of the intermediaries have often aligned
          against users, with publishers splitting between the two. This would almost guarantee
          user-hostile outcomes such as a return to transparency &amp; control regimes or the
          rejection of user agents as the user's fiduciary.
        </p>
        <p>
          This could perhaps be addressed with principles (which we need anyway, and that would
          prevent approaching users from an adversarial angle), which can't be changed without support
          from at least one entity in each constituency, and also from the fact that if such
          user-hostile tactics were to become supported in Garuda then the browsers would just walk,
          returning the world to ad blocking and the such. But that feels like a relatively weak
          protection.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another way to address would be to add a fifth constituency being consumer organisations
          (and having the browsers represent themselves only). But I have no idea how to select that
          polity.

        I stole a bunch of ideas from Mark Nottingham, and a few from Cullen Jennings too. Aram
        Zucker-Scharff, Mihir Kshirsagar, and Reuben Binns provided a lot of invaluable feedback.
        Many thanks to Juan Ortiz Freuler for organising a discussion session around Garuda at the
        Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society before it was even public, as well as to
        Levin Kim, Crystal Lee, Sahar Massachi, Tom Zick as convenors of the <em>Ethical Tech</em>
        and <em>Big Tech Governance</em> groups, and the attendees of the session for a spirited and
        constructive discussion.
